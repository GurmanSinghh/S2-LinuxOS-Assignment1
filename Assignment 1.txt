Make a directory under your home directory called documents. Next, make a directory
under the documents directory called spreadsheets. What is the absolute path
for the spreadsheets directory?

Answer 1: 

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cd
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ mkdir documents
{gurmansingh@localhost documents}$ cd documents
{gurmansingh@localhost documents}$ mkdir spreadsheets

Absolute Path: /home/gurmansingh/documents/spreadsheets

Use the cat command to create a two-line file in your home directory called datainfo.
On the first line, enter 144, and on the second line, enter 288. After the file is created,
copy it from your home directory to the spreadsheets directory you created.

Answer 2:

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cd 
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cat>datainfo
144
288
ctrl+d
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cp datatinfo ~/documents/spreadsheets 

Set the permissions on the datainfo file so that the owner, group, and others can read and execute the file. (Otherwise, leave the default settings as is.)

Answer 3:

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ chmod ugo+rx ~/documents/spreadsheets

Append the current month’s calendar to the datainfo file that is in your home
directory. Next, copy your changed datainfo file over the older datainfo file in the
spreadsheets directory, but use the copy option that prompts you before you overwrite
the file in the spreadsheets directory. Check the contents of the datainfo file in
the spreadsheets directory to make certain your copy was successful.

Answer 4: 

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cd 
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cal>>datainfo 
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cp -i datainfo ~/documents/spreadsheets 

Make the spreadsheets directory your working directory. Make copies of the datainfo
file in the spreadsheets directory, so that one copy is named myinfo and one is
named datadata. Next, use  a wildcard character combination to list all files that have “ata” as the second, third, and fourth characters.

Answer 5: 

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cd documents
{gurmansingh@localhost documents}$ cd spreadsheets
{gurmansingh@localhost spreadsheets}$ cp datainfo myinfo
{gurmansingh@localhost spreadsheets}$ cp datainfo datadata
{gurmansingh@localhost sppreadsheets}$ ls 
{gurmansingh@localhost spreadsheets}$ ls info 
{gurmansingh@localhost spreadsheets}$ ls ?ata*

Make certain you are in your home directory. Change your command prompt so
that it shows your current working directory with an exclamation point, such as
mydirectory! 

Answer 6:

{gurmansingh@localhost spreadsheets}$ PS1="\w"!
~/documents/spreadsheets! cd documents
~/documents! cd spreadsheets
~! cd ..

Change to your home directory. Use the rmdir command to delete the spreadsheets
directory. What happens?

Answer 7: 

Error message, directory not empty.

Delete the datainfo files in both your home directory and in the spreadsheets
directory. Also, delete the myinfo and datadata files in the spreadsheets directory.

Answer 8: 

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ rm ~/documents/spreadsheets/datainfo
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ rm datainfo

Change to your home directory. Delete the spreadsheets directory and then delete
the documents directory.

Answer 9: 

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ cd
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ rmdir ~/documents/spreadsheets
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ rmdir documents

Create a directory called secure under your home directory. Next, using the octal
permission format, set security on the secure directory so that you have all permissions
and no one else has any permissions.

Answer 10:

{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ mkdir secure
{gurmansingh@localhost ~}$ chmod 700 secure
